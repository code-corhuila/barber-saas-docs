# Per-Microservice Documentation Standard

> Defines exactly what documents each microservice must have, who writes them,

## Scope — the 29 repositories

The system is built as a polyrepo of 29 mandatory code repositories (norm 4.1: 5 + N × (2 + C),
with N = 8 domains and C = 1 channel): five cross-cutting repositories (`barber-saas-api-gateway`,
`-worker`, `-workflow`, `-infra`, `-front`) and three per domain (`barber-saas-<domain>-db`, `-api`,
`-app`). The documents below live in this repository; each code repository also follows the annex of
the course norm for its type and has a `README.md` with its purpose, how to run it and what it
depends on (norm 5.1).

| Repository type | Course norm annex |
|---|---|
| `-db` | A (PostgreSQL) or B (MongoDB) |
| `-api` | C (hexagonal service) |
| `-worker` | D |
| `-workflow` | E (sagas) |
| `-api-gateway` | F |
| `-infra` | G |
| `-front`, `-app` | H (the `-app` repositories apply it to the mobile channel) |
| all code repositories | I (CODEOWNERS, PR template, CI, board tracking) |

## Required structure for each service

Each microservice lives in `09-microservices/services/NN-service-name/` and MUST have:

```
09-microservices/services/NN-service-name/
├── README.md         ⭐ REQUIRED from Sprint 1
├── data-model.md     ⭐ REQUIRED before creating migrations
├── events.md         ⭐ REQUIRED if the service emits/consumes events
├── decisions.md      🔵 RECOMMENDED — internal technical decisions of the service
└── runbook.md        🟢 REQUIRED before first deploy to qa
```

And its OpenAPI contract in:
```
07-api/contracts/openapi/service-name.yaml   ⭐ REQUIRED if it exposes REST endpoints
```

---

## README.md — Service technical sheet

**When to create it:** At the start of the sprint where the service is created
**Owner:** Developer assigned to the service
**Update when:** Responsibility, ports, or dependencies between services change

Minimum content (use `_template/service/README.md`):

| Section | What it must say |
|---------|-----------------|
| Responsibility | One sentence: what it does and what data it is the authoritative owner of |
| Architecture location | Port, repository, DB engine, who it communicates with |
| Responsibilities (what it DOES) | List of concrete responsibilities |
| Out of scope (what it does NOT do) | What it delegated and to whom |
| How to run locally | Exact commands, must work |
| Related documents | Links to the other files of the service |

---

## data-model.md — Service data model

**When to create it:** Before the first migration script
**Owner:** Developer assigned to the service
**Update when:** A table/collection is created or modified

Minimum content:
- ER diagram (Mermaid) of the service's tables
- Description of each table with its columns, types, constraints, and purpose
- The database engine (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) and its ADR (norm 4.2.2)
- The migration tool (Liquibase or Flyway with PostgreSQL; Liquibase with MongoDB) and its ADR — the schema lives only in the domain's `-db` repository, never in the `-api` (norm 5.2.1)

**Rule:** A field whose reason for existing is not obvious MUST have a comment in the diagram.

---

## events.md — Service event catalog

**When to create it:** When the service publishes or consumes its first domain event
**Owner:** Developer assigned to the service
**Update when:** An event is added, modified, or removed

Minimum content:
- Table of published events: name, topic/exchange, when it is emitted, schema
- Table of consumed events: name, which service it comes from, what action it triggers
- Payload schema (can reference the OpenAPI or Avro contract)

See standard event structure: `02-domain/domain-events.md`

---

## decisions.md — Service technical decisions

**When to create it:** When the team makes a non-obvious technical decision about the service
**Owner:** Whoever made the decision
**Update when:** A new decision is made or a previous one is revoked

Recommended format: miniADR (without the full rigor of an architecture ADR):
```markdown
### Decision: [short name]
**Date:** [date]
**Context:** [what problem was being solved]
**Decision:** [what was decided]
**Consequences:** [known trade-offs]
```

---

## runbook.md — Service operations manual

**When to create it:** Before the first deploy to `qa`
**Owner:** Responsible developer + DevOps
**Update when:** A new operational issue is discovered or a procedure changes

Minimum content:
- How to verify the service is healthy (health check, key metrics)
- Known symptoms and their causes: "If you see X, the problem is Y, the solution is Z"
- How to perform a service rollback
- How to run DB migrations
- Configured alerts and what to do when they fire

---

## OpenAPI Contract

**When to create it:** Before implementing the service's first endpoint (API-first)
**Owner:** Developer assigned to the service
**Update when:** An endpoint is added, modified, or removed

**API-First Rule:** The contract is written BEFORE the code. Contract tests validate
that the code fulfills the contract, not the other way around.

Use the template: `07-api/contracts/openapi/_template-service.yaml`

---

## How to add a new microservice

1. If it is not one of the 29 mandatory repositories, record an ADR **before** creating it (norm 4.2.1)
2. Copy `09-microservices/_template/service/` → `09-microservices/services/NN-name/`
3. Update `09-microservices/service-catalog.md` with the new service's entry
4. Update `09-microservices/dependency-map.md` (or create it if it doesn't exist)
5. Copy `07-api/contracts/openapi/_template-service.yaml` → `07-api/contracts/openapi/service-name.yaml`
6. Create a PR with at least the README.md and the sketched API contract
